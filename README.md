# genetic-drift

This repo contains scripts for an [R shiny app](https://madeline-eppley.shinyapps.io/genetic-drift/) on the topic of genetic drift. This app was created for the Resources for Inclusive Education working group's module on genetic drift by Madeline Eppley. 

Please note that the R shiny app is hosted on a free plan through shinyapps.io. The monthly maximum run time is 25 hours per month. To avoid issues and be considerate to other users, consider displaying one simulation for your entire class rather than having students run it individually. The simulation *will* render slowly if more than 5 users attempt to load the page at the same time. 

If the maximum number of run time hours has been exceeded for the month, the app can be rendered locally using the files in this repository with RStudio.
